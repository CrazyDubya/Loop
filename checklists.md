# Loop Story Checklists

Quick reference checklists for ongoing work.

---

## Daily Writing Session Checklist

Before each writing session:
- [ ] Review current epoch's anchor list
- [ ] Check which loops are marked "to write"
- [ ] Review relevant equivalence classes
- [ ] Note current fatigue_state for continuity

After each writing session:
- [ ] Update tracking sheet with any new loops
- [ ] Mark written loops as complete
- [ ] Note any new equivalence classes discovered
- [ ] Update loop counts if needed
- [ ] Record any continuity questions

---

## New Anchor Loop Checklist

When creating a new anchor loop:
- [ ] Assign LoopID following convention (L_XXXXX)
- [ ] Determine epoch placement
- [ ] Set parent_id (if derived from another loop)
- [ ] Define key_choices vector
- [ ] Determine outcome_hash
- [ ] Assign/create knowledge_id
- [ ] Assign/create mood_id
- [ ] Add relevant tags
- [ ] Calculate subjective_duration (if sub-loops involved)
- [ ] Write narrative_hook (one line)
- [ ] Assign to equivalence class
- [ ] Update class count

---

## New Equivalence Class Checklist

When creating a new equivalence class:
- [ ] Assign ClassID following convention (C_XXX)
- [ ] Define outcome_hash
- [ ] Define knowledge_delta (if any)
- [ ] Set mood_delta (-10 to +10)
- [ ] Estimate count
- [ ] List sample_loops (1-5)
- [ ] Determine epoch_distribution
- [ ] Write narrative_summary
- [ ] Verify it doesn't duplicate existing class

---

## Epoch Transition Checklist

When writing an epoch transition loop:
- [ ] Confirm fatigue_state change makes sense
- [ ] Check knowledge prerequisites are met
- [ ] Verify emotional continuity from prior epoch
- [ ] Tag as "epoch_transition"
- [ ] Ensure psychological shift is dramatized
- [ ] Update epoch planning sheet
- [ ] Check this transition against others for consistency

---

## Sub-Loop Macro Checklist

When documenting a sub-loop intensive section:
- [ ] Assign MacroID
- [ ] Link to parent loop
- [ ] Define time_window (start-end)
- [ ] Estimate attempts_count
- [ ] Document best_outcome achieved
- [ ] Note knowledge_gained
- [ ] Describe emotional_effect
- [ ] Calculate subjective_duration contribution
- [ ] Update parent loop's sub_loop_load

---

## Continuity Check Checklist

Run periodically to catch errors:
- [ ] Knowledge states are consistent (can't use what isn't learned)
- [ ] Fatigue states progress logically (no unexplained jumps)
- [ ] Mood transitions are gradual (except at breaking points)
- [ ] Loop IDs are sequential within reason
- [ ] Parent loops exist before children reference them
- [ ] Equivalence class counts sum to ~1,000,000
- [ ] All anchor loops are assigned to classes
- [ ] No orphan classes (classes with no sample loops)

---

## Montage Writing Checklist

When writing a montage passage:
- [ ] Identify the equivalence class being summarized
- [ ] Note the count (for accuracy)
- [ ] Include at least one specific detail
- [ ] Reference emotional/psychological effect
- [ ] Ensure it doesn't contradict written anchors
- [ ] Check it fits current epoch's tone
- [ ] Mark class as "montaged" in tracking

---

## Pre-Draft Checklist (per chapter/section)

Before drafting:
- [ ] List anchor loops this section covers
- [ ] List equivalence classes to reference
- [ ] Note fatigue_state at start and end
- [ ] Identify any sub-loop macros to include
- [ ] Check knowledge continuity with prior section
- [ ] Review epoch-specific tone and strategy

---

## Final Review Checklist

Before considering the story complete:
- [ ] All mandatory anchors written (Loop 1, Loop 1M, transitions)
- [ ] Each epoch has sufficient anchor coverage
- [ ] Montage passages reference accurate counts
- [ ] Psychological arc is traceable through text
- [ ] No unexplained knowledge appearances
- [ ] Fatigue states progress believably
- [ ] Reader can feel the weight of the million
- [ ] Character transformation is earned
- [ ] Ending resolves character arc (not just plot)
- [ ] Math still validates (update tracking if prose changed counts)

## Quick Reference: Tag Conventions

Standard tags for loops:
- `anchor` - Key loop, written in detail
- `first` - First occurrence of something
- `breakthrough` - Major progress moment
- `moral_nadir` - Lowest ethical point
- `atrocity` - Deliberately harmful action
- `epoch_transition` - Marks shift between epochs
- `sub_loop_intensive` - Heavy sub-loop activity
- `return_to_humanity` - Recovery/reconnection moment
- `emotional` - Primarily emotional significance

---

## Quick Reference: Outcome Hash Conventions

Standard outcome patterns:
- `[target]_dies_[cause]` - Death outcome
- `[target]_survives_[condition]` - Survival with qualifier
- `arrested_[location]` - Arrest outcome
- `success_[type]` - Victory variant
- `timeout_[state]` - Day ends without resolution

---

## Quick Reference: Knowledge ID Milestones

Suggested milestone knowledge states:
- `K_000` - Baseline (loop 1 knowledge)
- `K_050` - Basic geography of the day
- `K_100` - Key NPCs identified
- `K_150` - Core conspiracy understood
- `K_200` - Full technical knowledge
- `K_250` - Mastery (knows everything learnable)

Adapt to your story's specifics.

## Quick Reference: Mood ID Anchors

Suggested mood anchors:
- `M_001` - Baseline normal
- `M_010` - First shock/grief
- `M_025` - Determined
- `M_050` - Obsessive
- `M_075` - Numb
- `M_100` - Self-loathing
- `M_125` - Dissociated
- `M_150` - Bittersweet peace
- `M_175` - Transcendent

Fill in intermediate states as needed.
